delete_module(2)				 System Calls Manual				     delete_module(2)

NAME
       delete_module - unload a kernel module

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <fcntl.h>	     /* Definition of O_* constants */
       #include <sys/syscall.h>	     /* Definition of SYS_* constants */
       #include <unistd.h>

       int syscall(SYS_delete_module, const char *name, unsigned int flags);

       Note: glibc provides no wrapper for delete_module(), necessitating the use of syscall(2).

DESCRIPTION
       The  delete_module()  system  call attempts to remove the unused loadable module entry identified by name.  If
       the module has an exit function, then that function is executed before unloading the module.  The flags	argu‐
       ment  is used to modify the behavior of the system call, as described below.  This system call requires privi‐
       lege.

       Module removal is attempted according to the following rules:

       (1)  If there are other loaded modules that depend on (i.e., refer to symbols defined in)  this	module,	 then
	    the call fails.

       (2)  Otherwise,	if the reference count for the module (i.e., the number of processes currently using the mod‐
	    ule) is zero, then the module is immediately unloaded.

       (3)  If a module has a nonzero reference count, then the behavior depends on the bits set in flags.  In normal
	    usage (see NOTES), the O_NONBLOCK flag is always specified, and the	 O_TRUNC  flag	may  additionally  be
	    specified.

	    The various combinations for flags have the following effect:

	    flags == O_NONBLOCK
		   The call returns immediately, with an error.

	    flags == (O_NONBLOCK | O_TRUNC)
		   The module is unloaded immediately, regardless of whether it has a nonzero reference count.

	    (flags & O_NONBLOCK) == 0
		   If flags does not specify O_NONBLOCK, the following steps occur:

		   •  The module is marked so that no new references are permitted.

		   •  If  the  module's	 reference count is nonzero, the caller is placed in an uninterruptible sleep
		      state (TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE) until the reference count is zero, at which	point  the  call  un‐
		      blocks.

		   •  The module is unloaded in the usual way.

       The  O_TRUNC  flag  has	one further effect on the rules described above.  By default, if a module has an init
       function but no exit function, then an attempt to remove the module fails.  However, if O_TRUNC was specified,
       this requirement is bypassed.

       Using the O_TRUNC flag is dangerous!  If the kernel was not built with CONFIG_MODULE_FORCE_UNLOAD,  this	 flag
       is  silently  ignored.	(Normally, CONFIG_MODULE_FORCE_UNLOAD is enabled.)  Using this flag taints the kernel
       (TAINT_FORCED_RMMOD).

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EBUSY  The module is not "live" (i.e., it is still being initialized or is already marked  for  removal);  or,
	      the module has an init function but has no exit function, and O_TRUNC was not specified in flags.

       EFAULT name refers to a location outside the process's accessible address space.

       ENOENT No module by that name exists.

       EPERM  The caller was not privileged (did not have the CAP_SYS_MODULE capability), or module unloading is dis‐
	      abled (see /proc/sys/kernel/modules_disabled in proc(5)).

       EWOULDBLOCK
	      Other  modules depend on this module; or, O_NONBLOCK was specified in flags, but the reference count of
	      this module is nonzero and O_TRUNC was not specified in flags.

STANDARDS
       Linux.

HISTORY
       The delete_module() system call is not supported by glibc.  No declaration is provided in glibc headers,	 but,
       through	a  quirk of history, glibc versions before glibc 2.23 did export an ABI for this system call.  There‐
       fore, in order to employ this system call, it is (before glibc 2.23) sufficient to manually declare the inter‐
       face in your code; alternatively, you can invoke the system call using syscall(2).

   Linux 2.4 and earlier
       In Linux 2.4 and earlier, the system call took only one argument:

	  int delete_module(const char *name);

       If name is NULL, all unused modules marked auto-clean are removed.

       Some further details of differences in the behavior of delete_module() in Linux 2.4 and earlier are  not	 cur‐
       rently explained in this manual page.

NOTES
       The  uninterruptible  sleep  that may occur if O_NONBLOCK is omitted from flags is considered undesirable, be‐
       cause the sleeping process is left in an unkillable state.  As at Linux	3.7,  specifying  O_NONBLOCK  is  op‐
       tional, but in future kernels it is likely to become mandatory.
