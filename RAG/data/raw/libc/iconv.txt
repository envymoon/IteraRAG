iconv(3)				       Library Functions Manual					     iconv(3)

NAME
       iconv - perform character set conversion

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <iconv.h>

       size_t iconv(iconv_t cd,
		    char **restrict inbuf, size_t *restrict inbytesleft,
		    char **restrict outbuf, size_t *restrict outbytesleft);

DESCRIPTION
       The  iconv()  function converts a sequence of characters in one character encoding to a sequence of characters
       in another character encoding.  The cd argument is a conversion descriptor, previously created by  a  call  to
       iconv_open(3); the conversion descriptor defines the character encodings that iconv() uses for the conversion.
       The  inbuf argument is the address of a variable that points to the first character of the input sequence; in‐
       bytesleft indicates the number of bytes in that buffer.	The outbuf argument is the address of a variable that
       points to the first byte available in the output buffer; outbytesleft indicates the number of bytes  available
       in the output buffer.

       The  main  case is when inbuf is not NULL and *inbuf is not NULL.  In this case, the iconv() function converts
       the multibyte sequence starting at *inbuf to a multibyte sequence starting at *outbuf.  At  most	 *inbytesleft
       bytes, starting at *inbuf, will be read.	 At most *outbytesleft bytes, starting at *outbuf, will be written.

       The  iconv()  function converts one multibyte character at a time, and for each character conversion it incre‐
       ments *inbuf and decrements *inbytesleft by the number of converted input bytes,	 it  increments	 *outbuf  and
       decrements  *outbytesleft  by  the  number of converted output bytes, and it updates the conversion state con‐
       tained in cd.  If the character encoding of the input is stateful, the iconv() function can also convert a se‐
       quence of input bytes to an update to the conversion state without producing any output bytes; such  input  is
       called a shift sequence.	 The conversion can stop for five reasons:

       •  An  invalid  multibyte sequence is encountered in the input.	In this case, it sets errno to EILSEQ and re‐
	  turns (size_t) -1.  *inbuf is left pointing to the beginning of the invalid multibyte sequence.

       •  A multibyte sequence is encountered that is valid but that cannot be translated to the  character  encoding
	  of  the output.  This condition depends on the implementation and on the conversion descriptor.  In the GNU
	  C library and GNU libiconv, if cd was created without the suffix //TRANSLIT or //IGNORE, the conversion  is
	  strict:  lossy conversions produce this condition.  If the suffix //TRANSLIT was specified, transliteration
	  can avoid this condition in some cases.  In the musl C library, this condition cannot occur because a	 con‐
	  version to '*' is used as a fallback.	 In the FreeBSD, NetBSD, and Solaris implementations of iconv(), this
	  condition  cannot  occur either, because a conversion to '?' is used as a fallback.  When this condition is
	  met, iconv() sets errno to EILSEQ and returns (size_t) -1.  *inbuf is left pointing to the beginning of the
	  unconvertible multibyte sequence.

       •  The input byte sequence has been entirely converted, that is, *inbytesleft has gone down  to	0.   In	 this
	  case, iconv() returns the number of nonreversible conversions performed during this call.

       •  An  incomplete multibyte sequence is encountered in the input, and the input byte sequence terminates after
	  it.  In this case, it sets errno to EINVAL and returns (size_t) -1.  *inbuf is left pointing to the  begin‐
	  ning of the incomplete multibyte sequence.

       •  The  output buffer has no more room for the next converted character.	 In this case, it sets errno to E2BIG
	  and returns (size_t) -1.

       A different case is when inbuf is NULL or *inbuf is NULL, but outbuf is not NULL and *outbuf is not NULL.   In
       this  case, the iconv() function attempts to set cd's conversion state to the initial state and store a corre‐
       sponding shift sequence at *outbuf.  At most *outbytesleft bytes, starting at *outbuf, will  be	written.   If
       the  output  buffer  has no more room for this reset sequence, it sets errno to E2BIG and returns (size_t) -1.
       Otherwise, it increments *outbuf and decrements *outbytesleft by the number of bytes written.

       A third case is when inbuf is NULL or *inbuf is NULL, and outbuf is NULL or *outbuf is NULL.   In  this	case,
       the iconv() function sets cd's conversion state to the initial state.

RETURN VALUE
       The  iconv()  function returns the number of characters converted in a nonreversible way during this call; re‐
       versible conversions are not counted.  In case of error, iconv() returns (size_t) -1 and sets errno  to	indi‐
       cate the error.

ERRORS
       The following errors can occur, among others:

       E2BIG  There is not sufficient room at *outbuf.

       EILSEQ An invalid multibyte sequence has been encountered in the input.

       EINVAL An incomplete multibyte sequence has been encountered in the input.

ATTRIBUTES
       For an explanation of the terms used in this section, see attributes(7).

       The iconv() function is MT-Safe, as long as callers arrange for mutual exclusion on the cd argument.

STANDARDS
       POSIX.1-2008.

HISTORY
       glibc 2.1.  POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       In  each	 series	 of  calls to iconv(), the last should be one with inbuf or *inbuf equal to NULL, in order to
       flush out any partially converted input.

       Although inbuf and outbuf are typed as char **, this does not mean that the objects they point can  be  inter‐
       preted  as C strings or as arrays of characters: the interpretation of character byte sequences is handled in‐
       ternally by the conversion functions.  In some encodings, a zero byte may be a valid part of a multibyte char‐
       acter.

       The caller of iconv() must ensure that the pointers passed to the function are suitable for accessing  charac‐
       ters  in the appropriate character set.	This includes ensuring correct alignment on platforms that have tight
       restrictions on alignment.
