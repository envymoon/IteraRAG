swapon(2)					 System Calls Manual					    swapon(2)

NAME
       swapon, swapoff - start/stop swapping to file/device

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/swap.h>

       int swapon(const char *path, int swapflags);
       int swapoff(const char *path);

DESCRIPTION
       swapon()	 sets  the  swap area to the file or block device specified by path.  swapoff() stops swapping to the
       file or block device specified by path.

       If the SWAP_FLAG_PREFER flag is specified in the swapon() swapflags argument, the new swap area	will  have  a
       higher priority than default.  The priority is encoded within swapflags as:

	   (prio << SWAP_FLAG_PRIO_SHIFT) & SWAP_FLAG_PRIO_MASK

       If  the	SWAP_FLAG_DISCARD flag is specified in the swapon() swapflags argument, freed swap pages will be dis‐
       carded before they are reused, if the swap device supports the discard or trim operation.  (This	 may  improve
       performance on some Solid State Devices, but often it does not.)	 See also NOTES.

       These functions may be used only by a privileged process (one having the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability).

   Priority
       Each  swap area has a priority, either high or low.  The default priority is low.  Within the low-priority ar‐
       eas, newer areas are even lower priority than older areas.

       All priorities set with swapflags are high-priority, higher than default.  They may have any nonnegative value
       chosen by the caller.  Higher numbers mean higher priority.

       Swap pages are allocated from areas in priority order, highest priority first.  For areas with different	 pri‐
       orities,	 a  higher-priority  area is exhausted before using a lower-priority area.  If two or more areas have
       the same priority, and it is the highest priority available, pages are allocated on a  round-robin  basis  be‐
       tween them.

       As of Linux 1.3.6, the kernel usually follows these rules, but there are exceptions.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EBUSY  (for swapon()) The specified path is already being used as a swap area.

       EINVAL The file path exists, but refers neither to a regular file nor to a block device;

       EINVAL (swapon())  The  indicated  path	does  not  contain  a valid swap signature or resides on an in-memory
	      filesystem such as tmpfs(5).

       EINVAL (since Linux 3.4)
	      (swapon()) An invalid flag value was specified in swapflags.

       EINVAL (swapoff()) path is not currently a swap area.

       ENFILE The system-wide limit on the total number of open files has been reached.

       ENOENT The file path does not exist.

       ENOMEM The system has insufficient memory to start swapping.

       EPERM  The caller does not have the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.  Alternatively, the maximum number of swap files
	      are already in use; see NOTES below.

STANDARDS
       Linux.

HISTORY
       The swapflags argument was introduced in Linux 1.3.2.

NOTES
       The partition or path must be prepared with mkswap(8).

       There is an upper limit on the number of swap files that may be used, defined by the kernel constant MAX_SWAP‐
       FILES.  Before Linux 2.4.10, MAX_SWAPFILES has the value 8; since Linux 2.4.10, it has the  value  32.	Since
       Linux  2.6.18, the limit is decreased by 2 (thus 30), since Linux 5.19, the limit is decreased by 3 (thus: 29)
       if the kernel is built with the CONFIG_MIGRATION option (which reserves two swap table entries  for  the	 page
       migration features of mbind(2) and migrate_pages(2)).  Since Linux 2.6.32, the limit is further decreased by 1
       if  the	kernel	is  built  with the CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE option.  Since Linux 5.14, the limit is further de‐
       creased by 4 if the kernel is built with the CONFIG_DEVICE_PRIVATE option.  Since Linux	5.19,  the  limit  is
       further decreased by 1 if the kernel is built with the CONFIG_PTE_MARKER option.

       Discard	of  swap pages was introduced in Linux 2.6.29, then made conditional on the SWAP_FLAG_DISCARD flag in
       Linux 2.6.36, which still discards the entire swap area when swapon() is called, even if that flag bit is  not
       set.
