time(2)						 System Calls Manual					      time(2)

NAME
       time - get time in seconds

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <time.h>

       time_t time(time_t *_Nullable tloc);

DESCRIPTION
       time() returns the time as the number of seconds since the Epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC).

       If tloc is non-NULL, the return value is also stored in the memory pointed to by tloc.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  the  value of time in seconds since the Epoch is returned.	 On error, ((time_t) -1) is returned,
       and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EOVERFLOW
	      The time cannot be represented as a time_t value.	 This can happen if an executable with 32-bit  time_t
	      is  run on a 64-bit kernel when the time is 2038-01-19 03:14:08 UTC or later.  However, when the system
	      time is out of time_t range in other situations, the behavior is undefined.

       EFAULT tloc points outside your accessible address space (but see BUGS).

	      On systems where the C library time() wrapper  function  invokes	an  implementation  provided  by  the
	      vdso(7)  (so  that  there is no trap into the kernel), an invalid address may instead trigger a SIGSEGV
	      signal.

VERSIONS
       POSIX.1 defines seconds since the Epoch using a formula that approximates the  number  of  seconds  between  a
       specified  time and the Epoch.  This formula takes account of the facts that all years that are evenly divisi‐
       ble by 4 are leap years, but years that are evenly divisible by 100 are not leap years unless  they  are	 also
       evenly  divisible  by 400, in which case they are leap years.  This value is not the same as the actual number
       of seconds between the time and the Epoch, because of leap seconds and because system clocks are not  required
       to  be  synchronized  to	 a standard reference.	Linux systems normally follow the POSIX requirement that this
       value ignore leap seconds, so that conforming systems interpret it consistently;	 see  POSIX.1-2018  Rationale
       A.4.16.

       Applications intended to run after 2038 should use ABIs with time_t wider than 32 bits; see time_t(3type).

   C library/kernel differences
       On some architectures, an implementation of time() is provided in the vdso(7).

STANDARDS
       C11, POSIX.1-2008.

HISTORY
       SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89, POSIX.1-2001.

BUGS
       Error  returns from this system call are indistinguishable from successful reports that the time is a few sec‐
       onds before the Epoch, so the C library wrapper function never sets errno as a result of this call.

       The tloc argument is obsolescent and should always be NULL in new code.	When tloc is NULL,  the	 call  cannot
       fail.
