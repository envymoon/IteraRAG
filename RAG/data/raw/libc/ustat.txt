ustat(2)					 System Calls Manual					     ustat(2)

NAME
       ustat - get filesystem statistics

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <unistd.h>    /* libc[45] */
       #include <ustat.h>     /* glibc2 */

       [[deprecated]] int ustat(dev_t dev, struct ustat *ubuf);

DESCRIPTION
       ustat()	returns information about a mounted filesystem.	 dev is a device number identifying a device contain‐
       ing a mounted filesystem.  ubuf is a pointer to a ustat structure that contains the following members:

	   daddr_t f_tfree;	 /* Total free blocks */
	   ino_t   f_tinode;	 /* Number of free inodes */
	   char	   f_fname[6];	 /* Filsys name */
	   char	   f_fpack[6];	 /* Filsys pack name */

       The last two fields, f_fname and f_fpack, are not implemented and  will	always	be  filled  with  null	bytes
       ('\0').

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  zero  is returned and the ustat structure pointed to by ubuf will be filled in.  On error, -1 is
       returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EFAULT ubuf points outside of your accessible address space.

       EINVAL dev does not refer to a device containing a mounted filesystem.

       ENOSYS The mounted filesystem referenced by dev does not support this operation, or any version of  Linux  be‐
	      fore Linux 1.3.16.

STANDARDS
       None.

HISTORY
       SVr4.  Removed in glibc 2.28.

       ustat() is deprecated and has been provided only for compatibility.  All new programs should use statfs(2) in‐
       stead.

   HP-UX notes
       The HP-UX version of the ustat structure has an additional field, f_blksize, that is unknown elsewhere.	HP-UX
       warns:  For  some  filesystems, the number of free inodes does not change.  Such filesystems will return -1 in
       the field f_tinode.  For some filesystems, inodes are dynamically allocated.  Such filesystems will return the
       current number of free inodes.
