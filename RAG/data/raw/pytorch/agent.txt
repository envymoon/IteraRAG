Extending the Agent

To extend the agent you can implement ElasticAgent directly, however we
recommend you extend SimpleElasticAgent instead, which provides most of
the scaffolding and leaves you with a few specific abstract methods to
implement.

Watchdog in the Agent

A named pipe based watchdog can be enabled in LocalElasticAgent if an
environment variable TORCHELASTIC_ENABLE_FILE_TIMER with value 1 has
been defined in the LocalElasticAgent process. Optionally, another
environment variable TORCHELASTIC_TIMER_FILE can be set with a unique
file name for the named pipe. If the environment variable
TORCHELASTIC_TIMER_FILE is not set, LocalElasticAgent will internally
create a unique file name and set it to the environment variable
TORCHELASTIC_TIMER_FILE, and this environment variable will be
propagated to the worker processes to allow them to connect to the same
named pipe that LocalElasticAgent uses.

Health Check Server

A health check monitoring server can be enabled in LocalElasticAgent if
an environment variable TORCHELASTIC_HEALTH_CHECK_PORT has been defined
in the LocalElasticAgent process. Adding interface for health check
server which can be extended by starting tcp/http server on the
specified port number. Additionally, health check server will have
callback to check watchdog is alive.
