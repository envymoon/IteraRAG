Guard

Background

The Device Guard abstraction in PyTorch provides RAII-based device and
stream management, allowing code to temporarily switch device contexts
and automatically restore the original device upon exiting a scope. This
is essential for operations that need to ensure they execute on a
specific device regardless of the current global device state.

For custom accelerators, a CustomDeviceGuardImpl that implements
c10::impl::DeviceGuardImplInterface enables seamless integration with
PyTorch’s device management infrastructure. For example, the OpenReg
(Open Registration) integration example in PyTorch provides an
OpenRegGuardImpl for the PrivateUse1 dispatch key, with the following
capabilities:

- Device Management: Save, switch, and restore the current device index
- Stream Management: Create, query, and switch between computation
  streams
- Event Management: Record events on streams and synchronize execution

By registering OpenRegGuardImpl with PyTorch, user code can use device
context managers like torch.accelerator.device_index(), and operations
automatically handle device switching via the guard’s RAII semantics.

Design

The guard interface class c10::impl::DeviceGuardImplInterface provides
three main categories of functionality:

Device Management

Device management enables switching between different accelerator
devices and querying device information. This forms the foundation for
device context management in PyTorch.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Functionality     Description                Application Scenario
  ----------------- -------------------------- ---------------------------------
  Device Query and  exchangeDevice, setDevice, Change the current device for
  Switch            getDevice,                 operations; save/restore device
                    uncheckedSetDevice         context in RAII guards

  Device Count      deviceCount (noexcept)     Query number of available
                                               devices; must return 0 on errors
                                               rather than throwing

  Device            synchronizeDevice          Wait for all operations on a
  Synchronization                              device to complete
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stream Management

Streams enable asynchronous execution of operations on accelerator
devices. Multiple streams allow concurrent execution of independent
operations on the same device.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Functionality     Description                         Application Scenario
  ----------------- ----------------------------------- -------------------------
  Stream            getStream, getDefaultStream,        Create and manage compute
  Creation/Access   getNewStream,                       streams for asynchronous
                    getStreamFromGlobalPool,            execution
                    exchangeStream                      

  Stream            queryStream, synchronizeStream      Check stream completion
  Synchronization                                       status, wait for stream
                                                        operations to finish
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Event Management

Events provide synchronization primitives for coordinating execution
across streams and measuring execution time. They mark specific points
in stream execution that can be awaited or timed.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Functionality     Description        Application Scenario
  ----------------- ------------------ -----------------------------------------
  Event Recording   record             Mark a point in stream execution for
                                       later synchronization or timing

  Event Blocking    block              Make one stream wait for an event from
                                       another stream (inter-stream
                                       dependencies)

  Event             queryEvent,        Check event completion, wait for event to
  Synchronization   synchronizeEvent   complete

  Event Lifecycle   destroyEvent       Free event resources when no longer
                                       needed

  Event Timing      elapsedTime        Measure time between two events for
                                       performance profiling
