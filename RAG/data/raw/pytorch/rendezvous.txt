Warning

The DynamicRendezvousHandler class supersedes the EtcdRendezvousHandler
class, and is recommended for most users. EtcdRendezvousHandler is in
maintenance mode and will be deprecated in the future.

Etcd Store

The EtcdStore is the C10d Store instance type returned by
next_rendezvous() when etcd is used as the rendezvous backend.

Etcd Server

The EtcdServer is a convenience class that makes it easy for you to
start and stop an etcd server on a subprocess. This is useful for
testing or single-node (multi-worker) deployments where manually setting
up an etcd server on the side is cumbersome.

Warning

For production and multi-node deployments please consider properly
deploying a highly available etcd server as this is the single point of
failure for your distributed jobs.
