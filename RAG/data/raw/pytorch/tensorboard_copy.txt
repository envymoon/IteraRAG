Once you've installed TensorBoard, these utilities let you log PyTorch
models and metrics into a directory for visualization within the
TensorBoard UI. Scalars, images, histograms, graphs, and embedding
visualizations are all supported for PyTorch models and tensors as well
as Caffe2 nets and blobs.

The SummaryWriter class is your main entry to log data for consumption
and visualization by TensorBoard. For example:

    import torch
    import torchvision
    from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter
    from torchvision import datasets, transforms

    # Writer will output to ./runs/ directory by default
    writer = SummaryWriter()

    transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor(), transforms.Normalize((0.5,), (0.5,))])
    trainset = datasets.MNIST('mnist_train', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)
    trainloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(trainset, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)
    model = torchvision.models.resnet50(False)
    # Have ResNet model take in grayscale rather than RGB
    model.conv1 = torch.nn.Conv2d(1, 64, kernel_size=7, stride=2, padding=3, bias=False)
    images, labels = next(iter(trainloader))

    grid = torchvision.utils.make_grid(images)
    writer.add_image('images', grid, 0)
    writer.add_graph(model, images)
    writer.close()

This can then be visualized with TensorBoard, which should be
installable and runnable with:

    pip install tensorboard
    tensorboard --logdir=runs

Lots of information can be logged for one experiment. To avoid
cluttering the UI and have better result clustering, we can group plots
by naming them hierarchically. For example, "Loss/train" and "Loss/test"
will be grouped together, while "Accuracy/train" and "Accuracy/test"
will be grouped separately in the TensorBoard interface.

    from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter
    import numpy as np

    writer = SummaryWriter()

    for n_iter in range(100):
        writer.add_scalar('Loss/train', np.random.random(), n_iter)
        writer.add_scalar('Loss/test', np.random.random(), n_iter)
        writer.add_scalar('Accuracy/train', np.random.random(), n_iter)
        writer.add_scalar('Accuracy/test', np.random.random(), n_iter)

Expected result:
