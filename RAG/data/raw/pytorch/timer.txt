Server/Client Implementations

Below are the timer server and client pairs that are provided by
torchelastic.

Note

Timer server and clients always have to be implemented and used in pairs
since there is a messaging protocol between the server and client.

Below is a pair of timer server and client that is implemented based on
a multiprocess.Queue.

LocalTimerServer

LocalTimerClient

Below is another pair of timer server and client that is implemented

Writing a custom timer server/client

To write your own timer server and client extend the
torch.distributed.elastic.timer.TimerServer for the server and
torch.distributed.elastic.timer.TimerClient for the client. The
TimerRequest object is used to pass messages between the server and
client.
