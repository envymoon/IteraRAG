Source File,Question,Ground Truth 
libc (fcntl64.txt),Why was the fcntl64() system call specifically added in Linux 2.4?,It was added because the original fcntl() call could not handle large file offsets in the flock structure.
libc (fcntl64.txt),How does glibc handle the difference between the original fcntl and fcntl64 for applications?,The glibc fcntl() wrapper function transparently employs the more recent fcntl64 system call where available.
libc (fcntl64.txt),What are the known limitations of the kernel's deadlock-detection algorithm for F_SETLKW?,It can yield false negatives/positives and limits the lock depth of its dependency search to 10 steps.
libc (fcntl64.txt),"Since Linux 3.12, what happens to an NFSv4 client's I/O if it loses contact with the server?",Any I/O to the file by a process thinking it holds a lock will fail until the process closes and reopens the file.
libc (clone.txt),What is the main difference between clone() and fork() in terms of resource sharing?,"Unlike fork(), clone() allows the child process to share parts of its execution context with the calling process, such as memory space and file descriptor table."
libc (mmap.txt),"When using mmap(), what does the MAP_PRIVATE flag ensure regarding memory modifications?","It creates a private copy-on-write mapping, meaning modifications to the memory are not visible to other processes mapping the same file and are not carried through to the underlying file."

libc (execve.txt),"What happens to the existing memory segments (stack, data, heap) of a process when execve() is successfully called?","The calling process's text, data, bss, and stack segments are overwritten by those of the new program being loaded."
libc (brk.txt),How do brk() and sbrk() manipulate the program break to allocate memory?,"brk() sets the end of the data segment to a specific address, while sbrk() increments the program's data space by a relative number of bytes."

PyTorch (quantization.txt),What is the difference between Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)?,"PTQ converts a trained model to lower precision after training, whereas QAT models the quantization errors during the training process itself for better accuracy."
PyTorch (save_load.txt),"What is the difference between saving a model via torch.save(model.state_dict(), PATH) versus torch.save(model, PATH)?","state_dict only saves the learnable parameters, making it more flexible for code updates, while saving the whole model serializes the entire class structure."
PyTorch (tensor_ops.txt),What is the difference between view() and reshape() when changing a tensor's dimensions?,"view() only works on contiguous tensors and shares the same underlying data, while reshape() can handle non-contiguous tensors by copying data if necessary."

PyTorch (scheduler.txt),How does the ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler differ from other standard schedulers like StepLR?,"Unlike StepLR which updates after a fixed number of epochs, ReduceLROnPlateau monitors a specific metric (like validation loss) and reduces the learning rate only when the metric stops improving."
PyTorch (grad_clipping.txt),Why is torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_ used during the training of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)?,"It scales the gradients to prevent the ""exploding gradients"" problem, ensuring that the norm of the gradients does not exceed a predefined threshold."
