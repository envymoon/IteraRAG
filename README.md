# Evaluating the Evolution of RAG: Identifying the Optimal Retrieval Pipeline via Quantitative Metrics

1. Project Overview
This project aims to identify the most efficient and reliable RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) configuration for a specify muti-source hybrid dataset. Instead of a static implementation, we explored the technological frontier through four iterative versions, using quantitative scoring as the ultimate compass.

2. The Evolutionary Path (Four Versions)
v1: Baseline - Simple vector search with basic chunking.

v2: Refinement - Enhancing embeddings and similarity measures (e.g., Cosine/FlatL2).

v3: Advanced Indexing - Introducing high-speed retrieval using FAISS (HNSW).

v4: Hybrid & Re-rank - Integrating BM25, RRF Fusion, and Cross-Encoding for maximum reliability.
